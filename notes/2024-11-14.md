# What *is* a computer?

++{"lesson_part": "main"}

- how, physically, do we get the components we have seen?
- what other components do we need?
- how are those implemented




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
How have computers changed over time?

- at the physical level
- what was the context and motivation for these advances?
- how does that context influence how we use computers today?
- how does that influence computing as a discipline?

## Let's start with a dictionary



[we can start with a dictionary](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/computer_n?tab=meaning_and_use)

- note that this starts with reference to a person.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
### Computers as people

 and this text this particular dictionary is useful because it also includes where does the term originated like where does in that particular usage start appearing and so these are these are pretty all right this is starting 1646 1707

- Use of the word computer to refer to the person still common how recently  1950s
- the movie [hidden figures](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/) is available on Disney+ with subscription or other streaming platforms for ~$4 streaming rental.
- the book [hidden figures](https://uri-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/10nopmq/01URI_ALMA21128298920002396) is available at URI's library





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Computers as Machines

Computers as machines started later. We started with mechanical, analog and then moved to electronic and then digital.

### How much do we talk about computers?

[how much do we talk about them changes over time ](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=computer&direct_url=t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0#t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0)

 how do we actually like physically make it be machine

He was 18 and  his father was a tax commissioner in France and he wanted to like reduce his father's workload

 so he invented this calulator machine and received royal privilege from France in 1649 to be only person allowed to build a manufactured Computing a calculator is like mechanical calculators

Contrast this royal privelege with the 1970s where in resolving some other conflict, a court that declared the content of the computer cannot be copyrighted and it's free for anyone to use the concept of a computer

##  How did this change over time?



calculators that are still analog so they're still working with mechanical systems using Waze electricity becomes easier

### So how do these thigns actually work

- [We can build an adder mechanically with marbles and wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDshWmhF4A)

As electricity became more available, they realized that in terms of mathematical operations, electrical components resemble springs and switches
 
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

## Early Computers


- first vaccuum tubes: or diodes
- diodes prevent flow of electricity in one direction and allow in the other. they can be used to create circuits that behave like the logical operations, and create the gates.
- diodes only are easy for `&` and `|` gates,
- transistors can operate as a switch or amplifier and can also be used to build logic gates
- they're faster, smaller, and better at more types of gates than diodes

## More Detailed Von Neumann

**Control Unit**

The control unit is the circuitry inside the processor that controls the flow of information. In other words, the control unit is responsible for sending the correct electronic
signals throughout the circuit. The control unit processes information, fetches from memory, and decodes information to make sure that the correct signals are being sent. The
control unit looks at instructions in computers memory and directs the flow of data, while also managing the organization of instructions to make sure that everything happens in order.
The control unit can be thought of as a crossguard that directs traffic flow (information), and make sure everyone goes through the intersection (processor) in the correct order. Some predecessors to the control
unit are the vacuum tube, and the hardwured control circuit. The vacuum tube was very bulky and sometimes unreliable, however the transfer of information was quick, hardwired control circuit are built to perform one specific funciton and cannot be modified without physical altering. The way that the control unit is build is through a series of registerm gates, flipflops, decoders, and digital circuits, a clock, and multiplexers. These all work in harmony to ensure that information is sent to the correct place, in the correct order - as there is no room for error in hardware. The control unit can be constructed using hardwired logic for speed (previously only option (predecessor)), or microprogramming for flexability, this is dependent on the needs of a system.

## Storage


- there are some thigns we have not yet seen in detail in that diagram
- Ram Is Random Access we can access it whenever we want we can read and write to
- ROM: is read only memory; the instructions are Permanently



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
In the stored program computers, the programs were in ROM.

The very earliest computers could not store any values without power.

## Experience Report Evidence

read through the timeline, add reflections on what historical facts are most interesting and what parts of vonn neuman architecure you are not familiar with. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What is overclocking a computer?

setting it to run faster, it can cause errors. 

It speeds up the clock signal, there is a safe amount that this can be done, where the disadvantage is only heat related.  If you speed it up too far, it can make errors in certain computations occur. 

### Is it possible to get computers even smaller and more efficient than they are now?

Yes, we have not hit limits yet, but we are close in some ways. 

This is a good explore topic. 

### What was the importance of binary code in early computing, and how does binary align with the physics of transistors?

Binary for computers as machines dates back to mechanical comptuers, they were analog, but still used switches, which gives binary. 

The transistors allow us to create logical gates, which is well suited for binary. 

### Why did von Neumann end up winning?

This is a good explore topic. 

### How did moving from mechanical parts to electronic parts make a better computers?

electronic computers were smaller and faster than mechanical computers

### What is the decisive factor in making a decision for technological improvement over ease of access, how do they decide the threshold of improvement that needs to be met?

It is not necessarily a clearly driven decision, it is partially margin. 

### Is there a way to access vram ?

This is a good explore/build topic.
