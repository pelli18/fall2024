# Working Offline

Today more clear motivation for each thing we do and more context. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we will learn to work with GitHub offline, this requires understanding some about file systems and how content is organized on computers. 

We will learn:
- relative and absolute paths
- basic bash commands for navigating the file system
- authenticating to GitHub on a terminal
- how to clone a repo
- how fetch and checkout work



**everything** is a file

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Let's get organized 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


For class you should have a folder on your computer where you will keep all of your materials. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will start using the terminal today, by getting all set up. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Open a terminal window.  I am going to use `bash` commands

- if you are on mac, your default shell is `zsh` which is mostly the same as bash for casual use. you can switch to bash to make your output more like mine using the command `bash` if you want, but it is not required. 
- if you are on windows, your **GitBash** terminal will be the least setup work to use `bash`
- if you have WSL (if you do not, no need to worry) you should be able to set your linux shell to `bash`

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Mac warns me that `bash` is not the default, but that is okay. 

```{code-block} console

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If you use `pwd` you can see your current path



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm
```

It outputs the absolute path of the location that I was at. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we start at home (~)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can **c**hange **d**irectory with `cd`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can **m**a**k** a new **dir**ectory with `mkdir`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

What you want to have is a folder for class (mine is systems) in a place you can find it. (mine is in my inclass folder, I have a separate teaching folder for outside of class time, like where my draft of these noes is)

You might:
- make a systems folder in your Documents folder
- make an inclass folder in the CSC311 folder you already made
- use the CSC311 folder as your in class working space


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd systems/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Next, we go back to where we want to be

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To go back one step in the path, (one level up in the tree) we use `cd ..` 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
`..` is a special file that points to a specific relative path, of one level up. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd systems/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use multiple to go up many levels

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../../../Downloads/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we give no path to `cd` it brings us to home. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we go back to where we want to b
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../../
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If you start to tab complete with a nonunique set of characters
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Do
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Documents/ Downloads/ 
```
it shows you th options and puts what you had back on the propmt. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then we can tab complete by adding enough letters to be unique. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


## A toy repo for in class



**this repo will be for *in class* work, you will not get feedback inside of it, unless you ask, but you will answer questions in your kwl repo about what we do in this repo sometimes** 

**only work in this repo during class time** or making up class, unless specifically instructed to

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Preferred: 

1. [view the template](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/template-gh-inclass)
1. click the green "use this template" button in the top right
2. make `compsys-progtools` the owner
3. set the name to `gh-inclass-<your gh username>` replacing the `<>` part with your actual name

```{warning}
If the template link does not work, you are not in the org yet
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Authenticating with GitHub 


We have two choices to Download a repository:
1. clone to maintain a link using git
1. download zip to not have to use git, but have no link

we want option 1 beacuse we are learning git
+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

For a public repo, it won't matter, you can use any way to download it that you wuold like, but for a private repo, we need to be authenticated.  


### Authenticating with GitHub
+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

There are many ways to authenticate securely with GitHub and other git clients.  We're going to use *easier* ones for today, but we'll come back to the third, which is a bit more secure and is a more general type of authentication.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



1. ssh keys (we will do this later)
1. `gh` CLI / gitscm in GitBash through browser


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will do opiton 2 for today

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

#### GitBash (windows mostly)

- `git clone` and paste your URL from GitHub
- then follow the prompts, choosing to authenticate in Browser. 

#### Native terminal ( MacOS X/Linux/WSL)

- GitHub CLI: enter `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.
- then `git clone` and paste your URL from github
 
#### If nothing else works
Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This is a special one time password that you can use like a password, but it is limited in scope and will expire (as long as you choose settings well). 

Then proceed to the clone step. You may need to configure an identity later with [`git config`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

**also go to office hours later to get better authentication**

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


### Cloning a repository

We will create a local copy by cloning

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git clone https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-brownsarahm.git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Cloning into 'gh-inclass-brownsarahm'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (5/5), done.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Confirm it worked with: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```

this folder was empty, but now we  have a folder named like the repo
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## What is in a repo?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can enter that folder
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-brownsarahm/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we compare the local directory to GitHub

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Notice that the `.github/workflows` that we see on GitHub is missing,
that is because it is *hidden*.  All file names that start with `.` are hidden.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can actually see the rest with the `-a` for **all** *option* or *flag*.  Options are how we can pass non required parameters to command line programs. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.	..	.git	.github
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We also see some special "files", `.` the current location and `..` up one directory

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`ls` can also take an explicit path as the argument to list a different folder than the current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
workflows
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use it with any relative path. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/workflows/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
create_issues.yml
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## How do I know what git knows? 

[`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) is your friend. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


this command compares your working directory (what you can see with `ls -a` and all subfolders except the `.git` directorty) to the current state of your `.git` directory. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## Closing an Issue with a commit


Next, we ran the one action in the gh-inclas repo, it creates 3 issues. 

Now we can make the about file. 

We added a file from the code tab in browser, titled it about.md and put some content in. 

In the commit messag, we used `closes #x` where `x` is the issue to close the issue. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we look locally, we do not see the file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
With git status, we see it thinks it is still up to date
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is because it only compares with the `.git` directory, not the internet. 
So, we can update that repo without changing the working directory with `fetch` 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 960 bytes | 240.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-brownsarahm
   0373342..0e7c990  main       -> origin/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now, we can do status again.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
now it knows we are behind
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```
but the working directory is still the same


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can use pull to update our local main branch

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Updating 0373342..0e7c990
Fast-forward
 about.md | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check the working directory
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
about.md
```
and it is there! 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Making a branch with GitHub and working offline

First on an issue, create a branch using the link in the development section of the right side panel. See the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) for how to do that. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


First we will update the `.git` directory without changing the working directory using [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch). We have to tell git fetch where to get the data from, we do that using a name of a {term}`remote`. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch origin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-brownsarahm
 * [new branch]      1-create-a-readme -> origin/1-create-a-readme
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and the second, this switches branches. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout 1-create-a-readme
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
branch '1-create-a-readme' set up to track 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.
Switched to a new branch '1-create-a-readme'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

again, we check the status

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

now it says we are on a new branch


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## Creating a file on the terminal

The `touch` command creates an empty file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch README.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can use `ls` to see our working directory now. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano README.md 
```


we used the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html).  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We put some content in the file, any content then saved and exit. 

On the nano editor the `^` stands for control. 

and we can look at the contents of it. 


Now we will check again with git.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`cat` con**cat**enates the contents of a file to standard out, where all of the content that is shown on the terminal is.  

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```
and we can see the contents

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In this case both say to `git add` to track or to include in what will be committed.  Under untracked files is it says `git add <file>...`, in our case this would look like `git add about.md`.  However, remember we learned that the `.`  that is always in every directory is a special "file" that points to the current directory, so we can use that to add **all** files. Since we have only one, the two are equivalent, and the `.` is a common shortcut, because most of the time we want to add everything we have recently worked on in a single commit.   


`git add` puts a file in the "staging area" we can use the staging area to group files together and put  changes to multiple files in a single commit. This is something we **cannot** do on GitHub in the browser, in order to save changes at all, we have to commit. Offline, we can save changes to our computer without commiting at all, and we can group many changes into a single commit. 


We will use `.` as our "file" to stage everythign in the current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And again, we will check in with git

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md

```


Now that one file is marked as a new file and it is in the group "to be committed". Git also tells us how to undo the thing we just did. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{admonition} Try this yourself
:class: anchor

Try making a change, adding it, then restoring it. Use git status to see what happens at each point
```
````{margin}
```{important}
If you forget the `-m` you will be put into `vi` or `vim` text editor. Press `a` to enter `~insert" mode (that will appear on the bottom of the terminal window), type your commit message, then press `escape` to exit insert mode. Then type `:wq`and press enter/return  to write(save) and quit.
``` 
````
Next, we will commit the file.  We use `git commit` for this.  the `-m` option allows us to put our commit message dirctly on the line when we commit.  Notice that unlike commiting on GitHub, we do not choose our branch with the `git commit` command.  We have to be "on" that branch before the `git commit`. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'create readme closes #1'
```

Again, we use a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) so that it will close the issue.
