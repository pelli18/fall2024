# When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work, only, sorry)

+++{"lesson_part":"site"}

## Setting the stage

To [prepare for today's class](prep2024-09-19) you examined an open source project. 

We noticed that while the contents inside and the distribution of languages used as well 
as the specific code, or the *content* of the files was all different, a lot of the 
*organization* was similar. 

Most had certain [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) and basic info files:
- `CONTRIBUTING`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`
- `README.MD`
- `LICENSE`
- `GOVERNANCE.MD`

## Important references 

Use these for checking facts and resources. 

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder, locally


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-brownsarahm/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And confirm we are where we want to be
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```
+++{"lesson_part":"site"}

Next get the files for today's activity:
1. Find your PR that I opened for you today that has the title, "9/19 in class activity"
2. Mark it ready for review to change from draft
3. Merge it

```{note}
in the issue PR it has the info about draft PRs in a link
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we pull to get the files locally:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 20, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (20/20), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Total 19 (delta 1), reused 17 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (19/19), 2.47 KiB | 126.00 KiB/s, done.

 * [new branch]      organizing_ac -> origin/organizing_ac
Already up to date.
```
Note how many things it got 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check out status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/fun_fact'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

we are still on fun_fact 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## How does git store information? 

In class, I received the following question
> Why are we  on the `fun_fact` branch, not `main`?

This is because of how a `branch` is implemented and how git runs. 

Instead of storing important things in *variables* that only have scope of how long the program is **active** git stores its imporant information in *files* that it reads each time we run a command. 
All of git's data is in the `.git` directory. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	ORIG_HEAD	description	info		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	REBASE_HEAD	hooks		logs		refs
HEAD		config		index		objects
```

We will learn more about these files later, but looking at one helps us answer the question

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First we will look at the `HEAD` file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/fun_fact
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked out branch. 

The other files with `HEAD` in their name are similarly pointers to other references, named corresponding to other things. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next we switch to main, since we want to be there for the files we merged anyway

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can look at the `HEAD` file again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```
it changed! because one the the things that `git checkout` does is update the head pointer. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So `HEAD` is a pointer to the branch, but the branch is also a pointer to a commit
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/heads/main 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
0c1271483e62e69b8b3fc329203617b7093413df
```
that file has only the hash of a commit

Each of us will have a unique hash, we'll learn more about why for next week
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but if we use `git log`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

```{important}
`git log` starts a program that you can exit with the {kbd}`q` key.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

The branch pointer matches the lastcommit where the HEAD and main pointers are. (`git log` also reads those files...)
```{code-block} console
commit 0c1271483e62e69b8b3fc329203617b7093413df (HEAD -> main, my_branch_checkedoutb, my_branch)
Merge: 0e7c990 c7375fa
Author: Sarah Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Tue Sep 17 12:50:51 2024 -0400
```

```{note}
This is truncated output for brevity
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now again, we can use git status

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We're behind, so the files we merged into main are not here yet
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
so, we  will pull
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

## Organizing a project (working with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project


Put another way, we are using organizing a project as the *context* to motivate practicing with
bash commands for moving files. 


A different way to learn this might be to through a slide deck that lists commands and describes what each one does and then have examples at the end.  Instead, we are going to focus on organizing files, and I will introduce the commands we need along the ways. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

next we are going to pretend we worked on the project and made a bunch of files 

I gave a bunch of files, each with a short phrase in them. 

- none of these are functional files
- the phrases mean you can inspect them on the terminal

+++{"lesson_part":"site"}

```{note}
file extensions are for people; they do not specify what the file is actually written like
```
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

these are all *actually* plain text files
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For example
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat API.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
jupyterbook file to generate api documentation 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
But our older files are as expected 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{note}
Here we talked about how those small files do not have a new line
character at the end
```

```{note}
On Windows, students ge the warning about {term}`CRLF` and {term}`LF`

There is [setting in git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitfaq#:~:text=With%20text%20files,in%20some%20projects%3A) that controls it.  For a good explanation, consider this [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf#:~:text=is%20also%20possible).-,How%20autocrlf%20works%3A,-core.autocrlf%3Dtrue) about how it works. 

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings) also has a whole file on how to work with this. 

[Wikipedia's history in the Newline article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#History) notes that the CRLF that Windows uses actually comes from the era of teletype machines. 
Unix adopted LF alone and Apple (pre OsX) used CR alone.  

[more OSs are described in a table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#History:~:text=Software%20applications%20and%20operating%20system%20representation%20of%20a%20newline%20with%20one%20or%20two%20control%20characters)
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### How does `cat` work? 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat --help
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
cat: illegal option -- -
usage: cat [-belnstuv] [file ...]
```
it doesn't have a help option, but the error still gives us the beginning 
of its documentation. it says there are options we can provide `[-belnstuv]`
and then we pass it a file `[file...]`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we run it without an explicit file, it uses [STDIN](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html#:~:text=Concatenate%20FILE(s)%20to%20standard%20output.%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20With%20no%20FILE%2C%20or%20when%20FILE%20is%20%2D%2C%20read%20standard%20input.) which we can see by trying it, or from its docs
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
each time we type things into STDIN, it outputs that
```{code-block} console
lksdfldkfds
lksdfldkfds
^C
```

we can ust {kbd}`CTRL` + {kbd}`C` (`^C` means that is what I pressed)
to exit. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Files, Redirects, git restore


we will work on a branch so that we can easily recover from any mistakes
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b organization
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'organization'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check status to ensure we are where we want to be and note that no files have been changed
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's review what is in the README

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Echo repeats things we pass into it

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "its finally fall"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
its finally fall
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

since the `echo` program writes to the STDOUT file, we can change it to write to another 
file by {term}`redirect`ing it to another file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "its finally fall" > README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

There is no outut of this command

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but we can look at the file 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
its finally fall
```
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


It wrote over.  This would be bad, we lost content, but this is what git is for! 

It is *very very* easy to undo work since our last commit.  

This is good for times when you have something you have an idea and you do not know if it is going to work, so you make a commit before you try it. Then you can try it out.  If it doesn't work you can undo and go back to the place where you made the commit. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

As always we start by checking in 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

it gives us a reminder, `use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So we do that: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git restore README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 
then check in with git again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check the file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```

back as we wanted! 




+++{"lesson_part":"site"}

Typically, when we write to a file, in programming,  we also have to tell it what *mode* to open the file with, and some options are: 
- read
- write
- append

This could be familiar from:
- `fopen` in C
- or `open` in Python
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

References

- [C language docs from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=functions-fopen-open-file)
- [Python official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)


*C is not an open source language in the typical sense so there is no "official" C docs*
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We can also **redirect** the contents of a command from stdout to a file in `bash`. Like file operations while programming there is a similar concept to this mode. 

There are two types of redirects, like there are two ways to write to a file, more generally: 
- overwrite (`>`)
- append (`>>`)
- 
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


We can add contents to files with `echo` and `>>`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "its finally fall" >> README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Then we check the contents of the file and we see that the new content is there. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
its finally fall
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We can redirect other commands too: 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status > curgit
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we see this created a new file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	scratch.ipynb
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		curgit			tests_alt.py
README.md		example.md		tests_helpers.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	tests_imp.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py	tsets_abc.py
about.md		philosophy.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and we can look at its contents too
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat curgit 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	curgit

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

this is not a file we actually want, which gives us a chance to learn another new bash command: 
`rm` for remove

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm curgit 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Note that this is a true, full, and complete DELETE, this does not put the file in your recycling bin or the apple trash can that you can recover the file from, it is **gone** for real. 

We will see soon a way around this, because git can help. 

*use `rm` with great care*


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -a -m "add a note"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we will add some text to the readme

```{code-cell} bash

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.

We also learn something about bash: 
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Finally, we will commit the changes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -a -m 'explain files'
```

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Would using > and >> locally create a merge conflict if the edited file also has a merge to it on Github?

*any* edit to a file could create a merge conflict, so yes one wiht a redirect can

### I would like to learn more about adding text into files, for example if you can add text in between specific lines when writing to a file

This requires more complex commands than we will use in class time, but it can be done with [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html). A tutorial on this could be a good {term}`explore` badge. 

### If I forgot to restore something for a couple of days and then chose to restore it a while later would I still be able to or is there a time limit to doing so?

There is not a *time* limit, but if you did other operations it can require different commands beside `restore`

### Can bash be used to trigger cursor events like mouse clicks?

I do not think so, but a [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser#:~:text=A%20headless%20browser%20is%20a,interface%20or%20using%20network%20communication.) allows you to automate browser operations, including selecting things that are most typically done by users with a mouse click, because in the browser clickable things are labeled in other ways. 

This is also a good {term}`explore` option. 

### What is different between using echo or nano to add to a file?

Adding to a file with `echo` and a redirect is nice for adding small changes, but not extnsive changes or changes to the middle of a file.  `nano` is a full text editor. In class today, `echo` was an easy way to demonstrate redirects, because it is so simple, but redirects are more powerful with more powerful commands. 

### A question that I have is about git pull, does it run git fetch beforehand to retrieve new content from the online repo Or is git pull just a completely different pocess to bring down content?


```{epigraph}
... precisely, `git pull` runs `git fetch` with the given parameters and then depending on configuration options or command line flags, will call either `git rebase` or `git merge` to reconcile diverging branches.

-- [official docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull#:~:text=More%20precisely%2C%20git%20pull%20runs%20git%20fetch%20with%20the%20given%20parameters%20and%20then%20depending%20on%20configuration%20options%20or%20command%20line%20flags%2C%20will%20call%20either%20git%20rebase%20or%20git%20merge%20to%20reconcile%20diverging%20branches.)
