# How do git branches work?

Today we are going to work with branches offline to begin to understand them better.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Git cheatsheets

High quality, correct refrences are important to gaining an understanding and being able to use tools well. 

```{important}
Checking for factual information is not reliable in LLMs. They can be a helpful coding assistant when you know what you want, buut they generate text that cannot be fact checked. 
```
- [visual cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;)
- [github cheatsheet in many languages](https://training.github.com/)
- [complete official docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

We are going to work between the browser and locally in order to simulate scenarios that most often occur in collaboration, but can also occur working alone as well. 
 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Back to the gh-inclass repo

Recall, We can move around and examine the computer's file structure using shell commands.

Open a new terminal window and navigate to your folder for the course (the one that contains other folders)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To confirm our current working directory we print it with `pwd`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
now change the path
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
then we can see what is there
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and finally go into the gh-inclass repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-brownsarahm/
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

this confirms what we expect

Now let's see what is in our folder: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check in with git


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Branches do not sync automatically 

Now we will look in GitHub and see what is there. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

**getting to GitHub from your local system**

the step below requires that you have the `gh` CLI. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo view --web
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Opening github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-brownsarahm in your browser.

```

Once we are in the browser, we created a PR for the readme branch then merged it. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Once we merge the PR, the [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) that was in our commit message applies. The closinng keyword did not apply on the non default branch, but it does once that commit is added to the default branch, which, in this repo is `main`.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git  status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-a-readme'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we go back to the main branch

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

It thinks that we are up to date because it does not know about the changes to `origin/main` yet. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
about.md
```



the file is missing.  It said it was up to date with origin main, but that is the most recent time we checked github only.  It's up to date with our local record of what is on GitHub, not the current GitHub. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next, we will update locally, with `git fetch`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), 911 bytes | 455.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-brownsarahm
   0e7c990..0c12714  main       -> origin/main
```


Here we see 2 sets of messages.  Some lines start with "remote" and other lines do not. 
The "remote" lines are what `git` on the GitHub server said in response to our request and the 
other lines are what `git` on your local computer said. 

So, here, it counted up the content, and then sent it on GitHub's side. On the local side, it unpacked (remember git compressed the content before we sent it). It describes the changes that were made on the 
GitHub side, the main branch was moved from one commit to another. So it then updates the local main branch accordingly ("Updating 6a12db0..caeacb5").

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can see that if this updates the working directory too: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
no changes yet. `fetch` updates the .git directory so that git knows more, but does not update our local file system. 

```{code-block} console
about.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Git Merge

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
When branches need to be merged they could look like this: 

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"C"
```



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
After merge, it looks like this: 

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"C"
    checkout main
    merge origin/main id:"H (contains A,B,C)"
```
There is a new commit with the content. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

In our case it is simpler:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
```

 so it will fast forward


```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    commit id:"A"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### git rebase

If a repo is like this:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch topic
    checkout topic
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout topic
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout topic
    commit id:"C"
    checkout main
    %% merge topic id:"H (contains A,B,C)"
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

after:
```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    commit id:"F"
    commit id:"G" 
    branch topic
    checkout topic
    commit id:"A'"
    commit id:"B'"
    commit id:"C'"
    checkout main
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Git Pull


remember git pull does: 
1. `git fetch`
2. `git merge` (default, if possible) or `git rebase` (if settings or with option)

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Updating 0e7c990..0c12714
Fast-forward
 README.md | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now, we can check again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```
and it looks as expected

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Viewing Commit History


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see commits with `git log`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

    Initial commit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


this is a program, we can use enter/down arrow to move through it and then `q` to exit. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## making a new branch locally

We've used `git checkout` to switch branches before.  To also create a branch at the same time, we use the `-b` option. 

A few examples:

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we use `checkout` without `-b` and an unkown branch name, 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout my_branch_checkedout
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
error: pathspec 'my_branch_checkedout' did not match any file(s) known to git
```
it give us an error, this does not work

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but with `-b` we can make the branch and switch at the same time.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b my_branch_checkedoutb
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'my_branch_checkedoutb'
```
so we see it is done!

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`create` does not exist 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch create my_branch_create
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a valid object name: 'my_branch_create'
```
so it tried to treate create as a name and finds that as extra

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This version gives us two new observations
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch my_branch; git checkout my_branch
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'my_branch'
```
It switches, but does not say it's new.  That is because it made the branch first, then switched.  

The `;` allowed us to put 2 commands in one line. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can view a list of branches:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
  1-create-a-readme
  main
* my_branch
  my_branch_checkedoutb
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
or again look at the log
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
commit 0c1271483e62e69b8b3fc329203617b7093413df (HEAD -> my_branch, origin/main, origin/HEAD, my_branch_checkedoutb, main)

```

branches are pointers, so each one is located at a particular commit. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `-r` option shows us the remote ones

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -r
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
  origin/1-create-a-readme
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/main
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
First we'll go back to main

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will make a branch for our next task. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git chckeout fun_fact
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
git: 'chckeout' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	checkout
```
I made a typo, but it offers a hint. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then it works when we fix the typo



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b fun_fact
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'fun_fact'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Creating a Merge Conflict




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```
we used the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html).  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor. 


this opens the nano program on the terminal.  it displays reminders of the commands at the bottom of th screen and allows you to type into the file right away. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Add any fun fact on the line below your content.  Then, write out (save), it will prompt the file name.  Since we opened nano with a file name (`about.md`) specified, you will not need to type a new name, but to confirm it, by pressing enter/return. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat about.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add about.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

**we are going to do it without the `-m` on purpose here to learn how to fix it**

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
[fun_fact 70759fd] add fun fact
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

without a commit message it puts you in vim. Read the content carefully, then press `a` to get into ~insert~ mode. Type your message and/or uncomment the template. 

When you are done use `escape` to go back to command mode, the ~insert~ at the bottom of the screen will go away.  Then type `:wq` and press enter/return. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

What this is doing is adding a temporary file with the commit message that git can use to complete your commit. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Now we will push to github.

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

It cannot push, because it does not know where to push, like we noted above that it did not comapre to origin, that was beecause it does not have an "upstream branch" or a corresponding branch on a remote server. 
It does not work at first because this branch does not have a remote. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To fix it, we do as git said.

## Merge conflicts

We are going to *intentionally* make a merge conflict here. 

This means we are learning two things: 
- what *not* to do if you can avoid it
- how to fix it when a merge conflict occurs

Merge conflicts are not **always** because someone did something wrong; it can be a conflict in the 
simplest term because two people did two types of work that were supposed to be independent, but 
turned out not to be. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First, in your browser edit the about.md file to have a second fun fact. 

Then edit it locally to also have 2 fun facts. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash

Now it cannot work because the branches have diverged.  This illustrates the fact that our two versions of the branch `fun_fact` and `origin/fun_fact` are two separate things.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch fun_fact
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
    branch origin/fun_fact
    checkout origin/fun_fact
    commit
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git gave us some options, we will use [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) which will apply our local commits *after* the remote commits. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull --rebase
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Auto-merging about.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in about.md
error: could not apply 62dcf61... local second fun fact
hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.mergeConflict false"
Could not apply 62dcf61... local second fun fact
```
it gets most of it, but gets stopped at a conflict. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

You are currently rebasing branch 'fun_fact' on '462402f'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

this highlights what file the conflict is in

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can inspect this file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

<<<<<<<< HEAD

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We have to  manually edit it to be what we want it to be.  We can take one change the other or both. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In this case, we will choose both, so my file looks like this in the end. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now, we do git add and commit

git commit -a -m 'keep both changes'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

  (use "git rebase --continue" once you are satisfied with your changes)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now, we follow the intructions again, and continue the rebase to combine our branches

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git rebase --continue
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

Once we rebase and everything is done, we can push.

:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How do I know if everything I submitted was done properly, or see a grade of somesort. I know comments are left but sometimes when I check I don't really know if I did everything right. 

If it's approved you completed the badge, if revisions are requested, then you need to revise. 

Starting next week, we will learn how to produce a progress report. 

### Why wouldnt you just use vs code or git hub directly?

Using the terminal is generally faster once you learn it.  It also allows you to write scripts. 

Some things cannot be done in browser, plus when you are writing code you would be working outside of the browser. 

### How common are merging issues?

Merge conflicts are very common.  It happens whenever a branch is edited in two places. 

### How can I merge the new branch locally, not from the website?

the `git merge` command

### Is it possible to have more than one merge conflict on a line?

on a single line it will count it as a single conflict, because it counts by lines

### What is the order of merge and rebase?

THey are two options for the same thing, but they put commits in a different order.
