1. Bring git questions or scenarios you want to be able to solve to class on Thursday (in your mind or comment here if that helps you remember)
2. Try read and understand the workflow files in your KWL repo, the goal is not to be sure you understand *every* step, but to get an idea about the big picture ideas and just enough to complete the following.  Try to modify files, on a prepare branch, so that your name is already filled in and `VioletVex` is already requested as a reviewer when your experience badge (inclass) action runs. We will give the answer in class, but especially **do not do this step on the main branch** it could break your action. Hints: Look for bash commands that we have seen before and  `cp` copies a file.
